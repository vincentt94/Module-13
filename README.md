  ## Description
  Through the use of Typescript & React, I was able to create a Candidate Search application that utilized the Github API and rendered information onto the browser to deploy informtaion for a potential employer to view information in regards to a Github user.  With some starter code prodivded, I emphasized my skills in react and typescript in order to develop the front end side of this application.  This application will render a randomly genereated user from Github on refresh and showcase some information in regards to that user.  Some of that information can include: their avatar, email ( if publically provided), location ( if publically provided), company (if publically provide), bio (if publically provided) and a link to their github.  If a user would like to save the information, they can hit a button which will save that users information to local storage and navigate to a different page in order to see all of the saved users from local storage.
